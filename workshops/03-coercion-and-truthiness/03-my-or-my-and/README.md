### My Or, My And

Define a function, `myOr`, that accepts three arguments of any type.

`myOr` should return the same result as the built-in `||` operator:

```javascript
```

Then, define a function, `myAnd`, that accepts three arguments of any type.

`myAnd` should return the same result as the built-in `&&` operator:

```javascript
myAnd(1, 'apples', true) === (1 && 'apples' && true); // => true
```
